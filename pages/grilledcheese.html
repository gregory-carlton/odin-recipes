    <h2>I grew up eating grilled cheese sandwiches made with Velveeta®, and I still think it's absolutely the best for this sandwich. It's flavorful, and melts beautifully. If you happen to have brioche bread on hand, use it because it makes this sandwich taste divine!</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>4 slices white bread</li>
            <li>4 ounces processed cheese food (such as Velveeta ®), sliced</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spread the mayonnaise on 4 slices of bread. Distribute cheese slices evenly between 2 bread slices, mayonnaise side down. Place the remaining 2 slices on the sandwiches, mayonnaise side up, and lightly press sandwiches to close.</li>
            <li>Place the sandwiches in the air fryer basket in a single layer, leaving some space around them.</li>
            <li>Air-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, flip sandwiches, and cook until sandwich is golden brown and cheese is melted, 2 to 3 more minutes. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may have to cook in batches.</li>
            <li>Slice sandwiches on the diagonal, and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
