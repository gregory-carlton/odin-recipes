    <h2>If you have been looking for a healthier way of making doughnuts, this recipe is for you. Air-fried and dusted in cinnamon-sugar or dipped in a glaze--all the flavors are there, but the calories of frying are not!</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        <uo>
            <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 (16.3 ounce) package refrigerated flaky biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury™ Grands!™ Flaky Layers)</li>
        </uo>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place melted butter in a bowl. Combine white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg in a second bowl.</li>
            <li>Separate biscuit dough into individual biscuits and cut out the centers using a biscuit cutter (or the bottom of a piping tip) to create a doughnut shape. Place doughnuts in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>Air fry at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip doughnuts and cook an additional 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove doughnuts from air fryer. Dip each doughnut into melted butter (making sure to coat top, bottom, and sides), followed by sugar-cinnamon mixture until completed coated. Serve immediately.</li>
