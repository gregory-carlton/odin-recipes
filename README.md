# odin-recipes
This is the first real project that I have done on The Odin Project. The point of this project is to create a basic website that features different recipes & hyperlinks to different recipes. This is considered a fundamental project to learn about using tags & creating a website on your own. The date is 05/03/2022

This project came to me easier than I originally thought it would. I learned a lot on this project already and it completely amazes me the difference between the 'asparagus' & 'donuts' web page is. The first web page took me a while to figure out & I even added a few of my own touches that weren't in the instructions on The Odin Project for the simple fact that it was bothering me and I wanted to add them. These include:
    Adding a home page to each page
    Adjusting the pictures width/height
I learned that when it comes to heading, you can format them inside of the heading as well as not needing to create a new 'paragraph' for the headings then for the lsits.

Overall I would say that I enjoyed this project and even though it was difficult at first, I powered through it and felt more confident in myself. I look forward to future projects.

Signing off.
